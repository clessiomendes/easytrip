  DAO classes for the Data Access Objects design pattern. All DAOs descend from AppDAO and must
  be obtained through the DAOFactory by calling:<br>
  DAOFactory.getInstance().get???DAO()<br>
  Direct access to the DAOs from the control layer is extremely disencouraged. They should only be
  accessed from BO classes and other DAO classes themselves.
