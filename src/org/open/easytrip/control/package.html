  Holds the control layer classes, standard Android Activity descending classes. 
  Interact with visual components (Android views) and the BOs. No business rules should
  be implemented here, except converting data from the view to the entities before calling
  BO classes.<br>
  Some Android specific interactions, like GPS and sound services, are maintained here to 
  keep BOs apart from the Android environment specific code. Don't dare passing 
  android.content.Context objects to the business layer.
