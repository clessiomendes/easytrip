Tasks:
5) Internationalize all strings and messages within the app.
9) Find other radar locations source, and international ones as well.
12) All user messages should stay in activities to be externalized. No messages in BOs, DAOs, etc. 
14) "amarelar" quando o GPS ficar mais de 2 x "intervalo de GPS" sem responder
18) Remove run in background setting. Act like google navigator. Always keep running in background, except if the user explicitly exit. Leave a notification.
19) Better sound alarms/beeps. Independent timer scheduler should do a better job.
21) Open a dialog from the service to show alarms while running other apps 

DONE:
1) DAOs are not thread safe (BOs are, for now). Each DAO is implemented as a sigleton hosted by the 
DAOFactory. Each DAO has an SQLiteDatabase db attribute which can be thread safe or not. If so, the 
DAO can be assumed as thread safe.
7) Implement database reload after an app version upgrade.
10) Restaurar telas apos rotacionar
17) Loading initial raw data file should be done through a DAO DP.
